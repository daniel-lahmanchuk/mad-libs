# mad-libs
This is my Mad Libs game which I created on May 5, 2023. I wanted to be able to create some cool Python projects to improve my skills as a programmer and developer so I searched up a list of some Python projects for beginners. I came across this list from freeCodeCamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-for-beginners/.

I decided to try and complete every item on that list start from Mad Libs and all the way on to a Space Invaders game.

For those of you who don't know what Mad Libs is, Mad Libs is a paper game where a player has to fill out some words like nouns and adjectives. Later, they go and fill out the story with the words that they picked earlier on. Down below I added a photo of what a paper (original) Mad Libs looks like.
